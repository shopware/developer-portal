# Shopware Developer Portal

_**Team DX is serving the teams to provide documentation to our customers.**_

Shopware has its history of creating and maintaining self-build and self-hosted documentations, which went wild after
the initial deployment, because there was no dedicated "owner" who directly maintained the docs and fixed bugs etc.

We want to make it easy for everyone to set up and maintain / preview / deploy the new documentation and have a
dedicated "ownership" so people have less to worry about. Ultimately - we want the majority of teams to adopt that
approach, not being force into. :slightly_smiling_face:

This repository:

- **provides Shopware Docs CLI** (`./docs-cli`) for embedding, previewing and managing embedded resources
- **reuses our official Vitepress-based
  template**
  [`shopware/developer-documentation-vitepress`](https://github.com/shopware/developer-documentation-vitepress)
- **embeds static files** from a dedicated `docs` folder (source) in sub-repositories/projects to
  the `src/<mount-point>`
  folder (destination) in this repository:
    - [shopware/docs](https://github.com/shopware/docs)
    - [shopware/frontends](https://github.com/shopware/frontends)
    - [shopware/admin-extension-sdk](https://github.com/shopware/admin-extension-sdk)
    - [shopware/meteor-icon-kit](https://github.com/shopware/meteor-icon-kit)
    - [shopware/meteor-component-library](https://github.com/shopware/meteor-component-library)
    - [shopware/store-api-reference](https://github.com/shopware/store-api-reference)
    - [shopware/admin-api-reference](https://github.com/shopware/admin-api-reference)
- **has a single deployment workflow** with the build being served from a single
  domain - [Developer Portal](https://beta-developer.shopware.com)
