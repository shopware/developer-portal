# Features

See official [VitePress documentation](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) for in-depth description of all features provided
by VitePress itself, such as Markdown formatting, frontmatter configuration and theme settings.

See our [Developer documentation Vitepress / FEATURES](https://github.com/shopware/developer-documentation-vitepress)
library for all globally available features.

On top of that, there are additional Shopware flavoured features globally available, provided by Developer Portal:

- `MarkdownTransform` and `TsGenerator` Vite plugins from Frontends
- Sitemap generation during `buildEnd` hook using `createSitemap()` helper
- Static assets copy during `buildEnd` hook using `copyAdditionalAssets()` helper

## Pros and cons

Here's a list of pros and cons using each method - basic (embedded) and advanced (standalone).

**General**

- **Configuration:** - configuration is kept at single place in `developer-portal`. Other repos can "flavour" it by
  using `docs-after-build.sh` script and `docs.yml` config.
- **Dependencies:** - dependencies are kept in `developer-portal` and `developer-documentation-vitepress` repos. Other
  repos only provide .md files and custom VueJS components.
- **Algolia search:** - index is updated whenever the main
  website [beta-developer.shopware.com](https://beta-developer.shopware.com) is updated, through
  the [algolia-crawl.yml](./.github/workflows/algolia-crawl.yml) GitHub workflow
- **Sitemap:** - sitemap is generated during the build process of the `developer-portal`.
- **Updates:** - Feature branch PRs are created in `developer-portal`
  using [create-pr.yml](./.github/workflows/create-pr.yml), [self-trigger](./.github/workflows/self-trigger.yml)
  workflows and [checkout-install](./.github/actions/checkout-install) action.
- **Navigation:** - navigation is configured in global [config.ts](./vitepress/config.ts)
- **Deployments:** - static build is deployed to Vercel, from
  the [checkout-test-build-deploy](./.github/workflows/checkout-test-build-deploy.yml) workflow
- **Content:** - contents are provided by all repos and embedded/mounted to the `src` directory in `developer-portal`,
  as defined in [data.ts](./cli/src/data.ts).
- **Custom features:** - all features by provided by `developer-portal` or `developer-documentation-vitepress`
- **GitHub actions:** - custom [checkout-install](./.github/actions/checkout-install) is provided and reused by other
  repos

**Both approaches**

- **Sitemap:** sitemap can be automatically generated by using the `readSitemap()` helper provided
  by `developer-documentation-vitepress`.

**With Developer portal (embedded) - single-project, single-build, single-deployment**

This is how Developer portal is intended to work.

| Feature         | Pros                                     | Cons                                                  |

**With Vitepress template/library (standalone) - multiple projects, multiple builds, multiple deployments**

This is how Developer portal is actually built.
