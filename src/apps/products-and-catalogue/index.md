# Product and Catalogue

A product catalog classifies products as categories and helps buyers make purchase decisions easier. Every product can be assigned to categories in two ways - [Explicit assignment or by Dynamic Product Group](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/commerce/catalog/categories#product-assignments).

## Changing the behavior

Do you want to perform any of the following:

* [Extend data loading to customize storefront templates](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-scripts/data-loading),
* [Cache configurations to improve the end-user experience](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-scripts/custom-endpoints#caching),
* [Defining of search criteria](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/framework/data-handling/reading-data#filtering)
* [Calculate stock availability](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/resources/references/adr/inventory/2022-03-25-available-stock) ?

Then this can be done via [App Scripts](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-scripts) that modifies the internal logic.

Also, you can read, write, extend, filter, and remove all the features of the product catalog via [Data handling](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/framework/data-handling).

## Changing the look

You can manipulate the look and feel of your online store's homepage, landing page, product detail page, product listing page, etc by assigning respective categories and entities to a defined [CMS](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/plugins/content/cms) layout.

On the other hand, you can customize the style of the layout with [apps](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/storefront/apps-as-themes).
